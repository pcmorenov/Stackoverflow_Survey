The libraries needed to run the code are the Python file, it works normal with version 3.


## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, it was carried out based on a sample of the database: Stack Overflow’s developer survey data from 2017.
The following questions of interest emerged from the data:

1. How does job satisfaction relate to earned salary and hours worked per week for professional developers?
2. On average, how much do professional developers earn and what size of company do they work most?
3. On average, how is job satisfaction and salary according to the importance of each person's education?
4. How is the job satisfaction ratio for professional developers who can work at home?
5. Is it possible to predict job satisfaction according to the survey sample?

The notebook has 'Markdown' cells where questions and comments are answered that explain step by step what was done.
